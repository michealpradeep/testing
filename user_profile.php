				<h2>Hey, Micheal Pradeep</h2>
				<h5 class="marginBottom3">Joshua Tree, California, United States Â· Joined in June 2010</h5>
				<p>It all began with a month long cross county road trip. We got in a routine of driving a few hours each morning, and spending the rest of the day hiking a National Park along the route.</p>
				<p>It was our first time to Joshua Tree, and it felt different than all the rest. Something about this place pulled us in and stayed in our thoughts. Exactly one year later, we found ourselves looking to buy a home in Joshua Tree. As soon as we stepped foot onto the property of the Joshua Tree House we knew it was special, and the perfect place to share with others who needed to reset, reflect, and create.</p>
				<p>After sharing our home and and hearing stories of friend weekends, engagements, and magical memories being made at the house, we couldn't help but design another space to share. We found and fell in love with the Joshua Tree Casita, and are so happy we get to share the intensely starry sky with you.</p>

						<p>This place is such a treat! We stayed at the Yurt for a couple of days and it was nicely decorated, clean, and cozy. We had a lot of extra amenities, like extra towels, pots, pans, dishes, and extra comforters that were at our usage during our stay - which was a very nice surprise. Bibi was very versed in her direction and communication with us and we were able to do a self-check in with no problem. She has a very nice crew and they were also very accommodating and responsive during our stay. </p>
